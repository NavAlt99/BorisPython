What is a function?

A function is a collection of 1 or more Python statements. It is an organized chunk of code that can be reused throughout a program.

Tell me a little about parameters, arguments, and return values.

A parameter is a name for an expected input to a function. The argument is the actual value passed in for a parameter. A return value is the output of a function.

What is a default argument? How do you define one?

A default argument is a fallback value that will be passed to a parameter if an argument is not passed during function invocation.

What data type represents nothingness or nonexistence or emptiness?

None

What is the difference between positional arguments and keyword arguments?

A positional argument is passed to a function by sequence (the order of expected arguments). A keyword argument is passed to a function by a keyword identifier.
