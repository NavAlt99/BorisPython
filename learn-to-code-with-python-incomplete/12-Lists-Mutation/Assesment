What’s the difference between the append and extend methods?

The append method adds a single element to the end of the list. The extend method can add multiple elements to a list from an iterable (such as another list).

What’s the difference between the pop and remove methods?

The pop method removes an element from a list by its index position (or the end of a list if an index is not provided). The remove method removes a single element from a list by its value.

Given a list

numbers = [1, 4, 5, 7, 9]

how can you overwrite the values 4 and 5 with 6 and 8?

Provide the code below.

numbers[1:3] = [6, 8]

What do the two arguments to the insert method represent?

The index position to insert an element in and the value itself. The list will be mutated.

What does it mean for an object to be mutable?

A mutable object such as a list is capable of change. It can be updated or modified in place without creating a copy.
